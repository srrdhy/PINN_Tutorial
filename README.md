# PINN_Tutorial

### Problem Description

Suppose we have a simple partial differential equation as follows.

$$\frac{1}{2}\frac{\partial u}{\partial t}=\frac{\partial^2u}{\partial x^2},\quad u(x,0)=\sin(\pi x)$$

If we look into another equation (2), you can see this is one of the possible solutions of (1).

$$u(x,t)=e^{-2\pi^2t}\sin(\pi x)$$

Now we will use (2) to create training dataset, build custom loss function according to the concept of PINN, train our model with or without PINN concept.

### Training Data Generation

Letâ€™s create our training data first. The sampling domain was set to be $(x,t)\in[-5,5]\times[0,0.2]$

### Conclusion
Using PINN can achieve good results faster within the same number of iterations. The LBFGS optimization algorithm can further optimize the loss based on Adam and achieve better results, but the running speed will be much slower than Adam.
